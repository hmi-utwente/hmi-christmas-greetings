<!--
Description levels in speech.

- the realizer will try the highest priority descriptions first. If it cannot deal with them, it will revert to lower levels.
- all synchronisation points must be present in all levels: if a realizer can ONLY realize the core-BML description, it should still have all synchronisation points available
