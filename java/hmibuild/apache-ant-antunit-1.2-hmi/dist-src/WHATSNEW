Changes in 1.2
==============================================

Changes that Could Break Older Environments:
--------------------------------------------


      assertResourceContains now first validates that the given
      resource actually exists using assertResourceExists - this may
      lead to a different error message than the ones generated with
      AntUnit 1.1.
    

      The XSLT stylesheets now create HTML files instead of plain text
      for logs sent to System.err and System.out.  You can always get
      back to your own reporting by providing custom stylesheets.
    
Fixed Bugs:
-----------


      Default XSLT stylesheets now properly escape XML in exception
      stack traces.
    

      assertPropertyContains was not checking the value of the property but
      the name of the property.
    
Other Changes:
--------------


      New assertion assertResourceExists and assertResourceDoesntExist
      have been added.
    

      It is now possible to pass references from the build file
      containing the <antunit> task to the build files under
      test.
    
        BugZilla Issue 49168
      

      Add experimental JUnit3 and JUnit4 adapters allowing to launch
      AntUnit script from JUnit runner.  The API of that code is not
      fixed and may change in future releases.
    

      expectfailure report the original build exception chained when failing
    

      Add a fail task that makes a test case fail if no condition is provided or
      if the provided one is evaluated to false.
